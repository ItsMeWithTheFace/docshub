title: "ERD to Shorthand Conversions"

## Introduction

Work through the following Entity Relation diagrams and convert them
to shorthand notation outlined in class.

An example of shorthand notation for an entity Course would be as follows:

> Course(**CourseCode**, Name, EnrolmentCount, *ProfessorID*)
>
> *ProfessorID is the foreign key of an entity called Professor*

In this case, primary keys are represented as **bold** attributes while
foreign keys are *italicized*. In an exam setting you can simply use a 
**hard underline** for primary keys and a **dotted underline** for
foreign keys. Also make sure you indicate which entity the foreign
key belongs to.
